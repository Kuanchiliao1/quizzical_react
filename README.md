# ü§ñ Quizzical

Quizzical is a React-based quiz application that allows users to input their own quiz topic, which is then generated using OpenAI's GPT-Turbo model. Users can bookmark questions, request AI-generated explanations, and receive AI feedback based on their current score. The application also stores quiz questions and user scores via local storage.
